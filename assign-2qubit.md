# Assignment: Simulating 2-qubit quantum protocol

## Objective:

This assignment involves understanding a specific quantum protocol described in [[Measurement induced chaos with entangled states](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3107)] , implementing it in Python, and evaluating its performance. The task includes a simulation of the protocol, iterating it multiple times, and calculating the fidelity of the resulting quantum state with a Bell+ state.

**Steps**:

  1. Read and Understand the Protocol:

Carefully read the provided paper to grasp the details of the quantum protocol. Understand the steps involved, the mathematical operations required, and the expected outcomes.

  2. Implement the Protocol in Python:

Write a Python function that simulates the quantum protocol. This function should take an initial pure quantum state as input, apply the protocol, and return the resulting quantum state.

  3. Iterate the Protocol:

Create another function that applies the protocol function iteratively for a specified number of rounds.

  4. Calculate Fidelity:

Implement a function that calculates the fidelity between the output state of the protocol and the | pp + > Bell state.

_Ensure to test your code thoroughly to confirm that it obeys to the protocol and produces the expected outcomes._
