## Overview

<p align="justify">
We are delighted to welcome Hena, a talented intern, who will be joining our team on May 20th for an exciting internship journey in the field of quantum protocols. This introductory report outlines the structure, objectives, and stages of her internship program.

Hena’s internship will focus primarily on studying quantum protocols under the guidance of our expert team. Quantum protocols lie at the intersection of quantum computing and communication, offering promising solutions to various computational and cryptographic challenges.

## Internship Stages

<p align="justify">
The internship will be divided into three stages, each building upon the knowledge gained and tasks accomplished in the previous stage:

1. **Stage One**: Understanding 2-Qubit Systems
    - Hena will begin her course by delving into the fundamentals of 2-qubit systems.
    - Her initial task will involve studying and reproducing some of the results presented in Tamás Kiss’ paper [[Measurement induced chaos with entangled states](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3107)].
2. **Stage Two**: Exploring 3-Qubit Systems
    - Building upon her understanding from the first stage, Hena will progress to explore the complexities of 3-qubit systems.
    - She will replicate and analyze key results from Áron Rozgonyi's paper [[Training iterated protocols for distillation of GHZ states with variational quantum algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2024.129349)], gaining deeper insights into multi-qubit protocol.
3. **Stage Three**: Intern Task – Higher Dimensional Systems
    - In the final and most crucial stage, Hena will embark on her assigned intern task, contributing to one of our current research projects.
    - Hena's goal will be to investigate the 3-qubit protocol, with a particular focus on exploring the dynamics of our designated quantum protocol to determine whether it exhibits chaotic behavior. 
    - By analyzing the stability and sensitivity of the protocol to small changes in the initial quantum state, we could uncover potential chaotic phenomena. 
    - This investigation would provide valuable insights into the robustness and reliability of quantum protocols in practical applications.

These internship offer Hena the opportunity to explore diverse aspects of quantum computing and communication, deepen her understanding of advanced concepts, and contribute to cutting-edge research efforts. We will provide guidance and support to ensure her success in undertaking these tasks during her internship.
